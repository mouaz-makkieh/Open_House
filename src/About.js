        Because of the current situation of refugees and immigrants ,<br />
        
        we as refugees decided to find a way to help them out and make it easy
        for them. So after a year almost of living in Barcelona ,<br /> we found
        out that many people would like to help but there is no proper way to
        communicate.
        <br /> So my project will help to connect the local people or people who
        want to help with people who are in need.
        <br /> As many refugees and immigrants don’t have a place to stay when
        they arrive to Spain while many people would welcome them but both sides
        don’t have the proper way to find each other.
        <br /> the website will help the refugees and immigrants to find a
        localhost that is going to host them for a few days till they find
        somewhere to go or to stay.
        <br /> The idea is really simple the localhost will go to the website
        and register their name and tell that they have space for a guest,
        <br /> and they specify for how long they will be able to host people.
        <br />
        hope you get what you expected in this website
